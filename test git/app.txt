Weather Channel New Design App

-Circles everywhere
-lots of scrolling (sooo much scrolling)
-Clean
-Hiarchy-I'm assuming the did user testing and found out which pages people looked at most and that's how they came up with the scrolling hiarchy
-Doesn't really have an ending to the scrolling
-Don't know how to delete old places...
-Ads inbetween sections but don't really fit in to the scheme (but that does help in making the obvious)
-no depth to the app
-overall like the new design and matches what Steven said in class about circles
